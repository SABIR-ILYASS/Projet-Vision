## Goals
The objective is to realize a Windows application, developed using Python and its libraries. 
The application must respect the following main points:

**Creation of user-friendly interfaces:**
- Design and realization of the simple interfaces, with a user aid that helps guide the user to fully understand the different functionalities of the application. 

**Identification of people:**
- Identification of all people who appear in the video.

**Tracking of persons:** 
- Assigning a unique identifier to each person.

**Calculation of the speed of people:**
- Analysis of the movement of people (walking...)

**Determination of the direction of movement:** 
- Determines the direction of movement of each detected person. 
- Determines the direction of movement of the most of the persons. Useful in situations where people have to respect only one direction of movement). 

**Estimate the distances between people:**
- Determining the distances between each pair of people. 
In the context of respecting sanitary precautionary measures for example.

The following features will be implemented in the project:
 A button to import the video.
A pause/resume video button.
A user help button.
A button to show/hide speed vectors.
A statistics button.
